# Assignment: Implement Unix `head` Command in JavaScript

## Overview

The `head` command is a Unix utility that displays the first part of files. Your
task is to implement a JavaScript version of this command that mimics its
behavior.

The command should work with both files and standard input (stdin).

## Basic Behavior

By default, `head` displays the first **10 lines** of each specified file.

### Example:

Given a file `numbers.txt`:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
```

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js numbers.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

---

## Options to Implement

### 1. `-n <count>` — Specify Number of Lines

Display the first `<count>` lines of each file.

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js -n 3 numbers.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
1
2
3
```

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js -n 15 numbers.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
```

---

### 2. `-c <bytes>` — Specify Number of Bytes

Display the first `<bytes>` bytes of each file.

Given a file `poem.txt`:

```
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Sugar is sweet,
And so are you.
```

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js -c 20 poem.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Roses are red,
Viole
```

**Note:** The output includes exactly 20 bytes (characters), including newlines.

---

### 3. Multiple Files

When multiple files are specified, `head` should display the contents of each
file with a header showing the filename.

Given files `file1.txt`:

```
Line 1 of file1
Line 2 of file1
Line 3 of file1
```

And `file2.txt`:

```
Line 1 of file2
Line 2 of file2
Line 3 of file2
```

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js -n 2 file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
==> file1.txt <==
Line 1 of file1
Line 2 of file1

==> file2.txt <==
Line 1 of file2
Line 2 of file2
```

## **Note:** There should be a blank line between different files' outputs.

### 4. `-q` — Quiet Mode (Suppress Headers)

Never print headers giving file names, even when processing multiple files.

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js -q -n 2 file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Line 1 of file1
Line 2 of file1
Line 1 of file2
Line 2 of file2
```

---

## Reading from Standard Input

When no file is specified, `head` should read from standard input.

### Example 1: No File Specified

**Command:**

```bash
echo -e "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 4\nLine 5" | deno head.js -n 3
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```

---

## Error Handling

Your implementation should handle errors gracefully:

### File Not Found

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js nonexistent.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
head: nonexistent.txt: No such file or directory
```

### Multiple Files with Some Missing

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js file1.txt missing.txt file2.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
==> file1.txt <==
Line 1 of file1
Line 2 of file1
Line 3 of file1
Line 4 of file1
Line 5 of file1
Line 6 of file1
Line 7 of file1
Line 8 of file1
Line 9 of file1
Line 10 of file1

head: missing.txt: No such file or directory

==> file2.txt <==
Line 1 of file2
Line 2 of file2
Line 3 of file2
Line 4 of file2
Line 5 of file2
Line 6 of file2
Line 7 of file2
Line 8 of file2
Line 9 of file2
Line 10 of file2
```

### Invalid Option

**Command:**

```bash
deno head.js -n abc file1.txt
```

**Expected Output:**

```
head: illegal line count -- abc
```

---

## Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Empty Files:** Should produce no output for that file.
2. **Files Shorter Than Requested Lines:** Display all available lines/bytes.
3. **Combining Options:** `-n` and `-c` should not be used together (last one
   wins or show error).
4. **Line Count of 0:** Should produce no output.
5. **Files with No Trailing Newline:** Handle correctly without adding extra
   newlines.

---

## Implementation Requirements

1. Use deno.js for implementation
2. Read command-line arguments to determine options and files
3. Handle both file I/O and stdin operations
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Match the output format exactly as shown in examples
